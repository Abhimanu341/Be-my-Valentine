# Be My Valentine Web Page

This is a fun little interactive web page where users are asked, "Will You Be My Valentine?" with two buttons: "Yes" and "No." However, if the user tries to click "No," the button moves away, making it impossible to click. The user is only left with one choice â€” "Yes!"

## Features
- Clicking the **Yes** button will show a sweet message.
- Clicking the **No** button is impossible because it moves away when hovered over.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity (moving the "No" button and displaying the message).

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enjoy the interactive Valentine's Day proposal
